    "Dedicated sites for preparing takeaway meals for delivery-only known as \"dark kitchens\" have been widely adopted across the food service industry throughout the past half decade. Dark kitchens enable restaurants to seperate their delivery business from in-house business and operate from non-residential central locations where overhead and operating costs are reduced. Understanding the successes and failures of this service model could provide useful insights into emerging forms of economic planning, risk management, urban design and food distribution. However there is a lack of detailed data on the growth and current state of dark kitchens within the UK.\n",
    "\n",
    "To the best of our knowledge, a map of the UK's dark kitchen locations does not exist. Therefore we set out to make one for Deliveroo's UK dark kitchen facilities, known as 'Editions', to better understand their growth and current state.\n",

    "## Locating Editions\n",
    "\n",

    "Deliveroo Editions launched in May 2017 as a concept to put 'an end to postcode food envy'. Initially trialed in Camberwell, Battersea, Dulwich and Canary Wharf, Deliveroo announced there ambition to scale to [30 locations across the UK](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deliveroo-editions-local-restaurants) within the first year. The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine maintains a capture of the webpage for the original Deliveroo Editions announcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/editions_launch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To find restaurants using Deliveroo's dark kitchens, known as Editions partners, we can add `tags=deliveroo+editions` as a query string when searching for restaurants near a given location. For example to find all the Editions partners delivering to Stepney Green, we can try: `https://deliveroo.co.uk/restaurants/london/stepney-green?fulfillment_method=DELIVERY&tags=deliveroo+editions`:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/query.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we load the webpage for Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, we can identify the partner is based at \"Whitechapel Editions\" from the location name in restaurant's url: `https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/London/whitechapel-editions/popeyes-editions-wme/?day=today&geohash=gcpvngtckn3c&time=ASAP`. Therefore the address for Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen is also the address for Whitechapel Editions which happens to be 10 Assembly Passage, London, E14UT, a [2-storey B-class office space with a disco ball included built in 1906](https://www.loopnet.co.uk/Listing/10-40-Assembly-Passage-London/8354101/) right next to the busy A11 road into central London.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/assembly.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "To find all the other partners based at Whitechapel Editions (`london/whitechapel-editions`), we can search for Editions partners (`tags=deliveroo+editions`) nearby with the following url: `https://deliveroo.co.uk/restaurants/london/whitechapel-editions?fulfillment_method=DELIVERY&tags=deliveroo+editions`. We can deduce that all the restaurants based 0.0 miles away are those at the Editions kitchen and can validate this by checking for `whitechapel-editions` in their urls.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/whitechapel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this approach, we can trawl the Internet Archive for Deliveroo's historic data and explore the possibility of charting the growth of Editions since 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Historic Editions Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Deliveroo's website has been archived many times by the Wayback Machine. Some of the captured webpages include search results specific to UK locations with Deliveroo Editions filters. Unfortunately only 46 webpages with Editions search results could be retrieved, each of which was captured between 1 and 5 times over a period of 2 years. This data is likely too sparse to allow for detailed analysis of the growth of Editions in the UK. However the data has some utility in providing an incomplete historic list of Editions partners between 2020 and 2022.\n",
