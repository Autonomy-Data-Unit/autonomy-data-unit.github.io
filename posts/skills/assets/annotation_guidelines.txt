Annotation Guidelines
---
A.1 Span Specifications
---
1. A skill starts with a VERB, otherwise (ADJECTIVE) + NOUN
1.1 Modal verbs are not tagged:
  • Can [put personal touch on the menu]SKILL .
  • Will [train new staff]SKILL .
---
2. Split up phrases with prepositions and/or conjunctions
2.1 Unless the conjunction coordinates two nouns functioning as one argument:
  • [Coordinate parties and conferences]SKILL .
2.2 Do not tag skills with anaphoric pronouns, only tag preceding skill:
  • [Prioritizing tasks]SKILL and identifying those that are most important.
2.3 Split nouns and adjectives that are coordinated if they do not have a verb attached:
  • Be [inquisitive]SKILL and [proactive]SKILL .
2.4 If there is a listing of skill tags and they lead up to different subtasks, we split them:
  • [keep up the high level of quality in our team]SKILL through [reviews]SKILL , [pairing]SKILL and [mentoring]SKILL .
---
3. If there is relevant information appended after irrelevant information (e.g., info specific to a company)
we try to make the skill as short as possible:
  • [providing the best solution]SKILL for Siemens Gamesa in a very [structured]SKILL and [analytic]SKILL manner.
---
4. Note also the word skills can be included in the span of the component if leaving it out
makes it nonsensical:
  • [personal skills]SKILL → just [personal] would make it nonsensical.
---
5. Parentheses after a skill tag are included if they elaborate the component before them or if they are an
abbreviation of the component.
---
6. Inclusion of adverbials in components. Adverbials are included if it concerns the manner of doing
something. All others are excluded:
  • like to [solve technical challenges independently]SKILL .
  • [communicates openly]SKILL .
  • [striving for the best]SKILL in all that they do.
  • [Deliver first class customer service]SKILL to our guests.
  • [Making the right decisions]SKILL early in the process.
---
7. Attitudes as skills. We annotate attitudes as a skill:
  • a [can-do-approach]SKILL → we leave out articles from the attitude.
8. Attitudes are not tagged if they contain skill/knowledge components—then only the span of the skill is
tagged.
  • like to [solve technical challenges independently]SKILL .
  • enjoy [working in a team]SKILL .
---
9. Miscellaneous:
9.1 Do not tag ironic skills (e.g., lazy).
9.2 Avoid nesting of skills, annotate it as one span.
9.3 We annotate all skills that are part of sections such as “requirements”, “good-to-haves”,
“great-to-knows”, “optionals”, “after this x months of training you’ll be able to...”, “At the job you’re going to...”.
9.4 When there is a general standard that can be added to the skill, we add these:
  • [Process payments according to the [...] standards]SKILL .
---

A.2 Other Specifications
---
1. Rule-of-thumb: If in doubt, annotate it as a skill.
---
2. We try to keep the skill components as short as possible (i.e., exclude information at the
end if it makes it too specific for the job).
---
3. We do not include “fluff” and “triggers” (i.e., words that indicate a skill component will
follow: “advanced skills in [...]SKILL ”) around the components, including degree. This goes for
both before and after:
  • [Manual handling]SKILL tasks.
---
4. Pay attention to expressions such as “participation in...”, “contributing”, and “transfer (knowledge)”.
These are usually not considered skills.
  • Contribute to the enjoyable and collaborative work environment.
  • Participation in the Department’s regular research activities.
  • Desire to be part of something meaningful and innovative.
---
5. Skills components that are found in not-so-straightforward places (e.g., project
descriptions) are annotated as well, if they relate to the position.
---
6. Occupations and positions in companies/academia should be excluded.
---
7. If there’s a skill component in the position, we exclude it as well.
  • Experienced Java Engineer. → completely untagged.
---
8. Only annotate the skills that are related to the position.
8.1. This includes skills that are specific for the position as well (e.g., skills of a ruminants
professor versus math professor).
8.2 Also skills that the person for the position is expected to do in the future.
8.3 This does not include skills describing only the company, the group you will
join in the department, and so on. Only annotate if it is specified or implied that the employee should
possess the skill as well.
